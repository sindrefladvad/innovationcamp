            <h3>Solve severe global problems through AI for humanitarian action</h3>

            <p>

                Dropouts and absence in school is a global problem. The reasons for why people do not attend school are complex
                <br>
                and there is rarely a one size fits all solution. In order to reduce absence and increase the quality of education
                <br>
                we need to think differently. Global poverty, climate disasters, weak incentives and inefficient AID
                <br>
                could be eliviated by AIDE, an advanced AI solution targeted to help those in most need for help.
